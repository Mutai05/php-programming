## What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language that enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications. It's widely used for developing websites, web applications, and web services. PHP scripts are executed on the web server, generating HTML content that's sent to the client's browser.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Scripting:** PHP code is executed on the web server, allowing for dynamic content generation.
- **Open Source:** PHP is open-source, fostering a large and active community of developers.
- **Cross-Platform:** PHP works on various operating systems and web servers.
- **Embeddable:** PHP code can be seamlessly embedded within HTML.
- **Database Integration:** PHP provides robust database support for data manipulation.
- **Function Library:** A vast collection of functions and classes simplify common tasks.
- **Frameworks:** PHP frameworks like Laravel offer structured development environments.
- **Security:** PHP includes security features to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- **Community:** A thriving community provides resources, tutorials, and support.

## Getting Started

To start learning PHP, you'll need a web server with PHP installed. You can install PHP on your local machine or use online development environments. Here's a simple example of a PHP script:

```php
<?php
    $name = "John";
    echo "Hello, $name!";
?>
```

Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support.
Create a .php file in your web server's root directory.
Open the file in a browser to see the output.
